# Solana NFT Drop Project

[Try the app and see your NFT, mint it right now 🚀](https://vercel.com/mueslint/solana-nft-retro-tape)

### Welcome 👋
This is a project to learn how NFT are managed on Solana based on the awesome tutorial made by buildspace! 


### Key learnings
- As everything is an account in Solana, so does are NFTs 🖼️
- A `Candy Machine` program is deployed on Solana to distribute the deployed NFTs (we used `metaplex` ecosystem)
- Client side and Blockchain side of RPC can talk once IDL has been fetched: It is a standard done so they can talk as they could be/are written in different languages
- You have to pay rents for Accounts to validator to hold data, when deploying NFT we ask for how much lamports it cost to be exempted of rent so that our NFT doesn't disappear in the wild haha
- Solana can be considered a little bit like a distributed file system where files (accounts) are stored/callabled at a dedicated path (address)

### Overlook 👀

Nice additions planned:
- [x] finish uploading 10+ others variations of the NFT (handmade variations 😢), waiting for devnet to be reachable after they updates it...
- [x] deploy the app on Vercel
- [ ] add rarity and make a basic trait system: seems huge work ^^
